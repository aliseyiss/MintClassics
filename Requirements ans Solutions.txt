1.Optimizing Warehouse Configuration:

To address the question of item storage and potential warehouse elimination, SQL codes one to four were executed. Query 2.1 sheds light on the current product storage locations, revealing surplus items. Although warehouses are denoted as North, West, East, and South, their specific locations are unspecified. It is assumed that these warehouses are located in the USA. Additionally, two new tables have been created to cluster states into four relevant regions, facilitating the connection of customers in the USA to specific warehouses. This relationship can be leveraged in subsequent steps to minimize transportation duration to customers. Query 3.2 highlights that 15,910 total sales in the West region and 19,934 total sales in the East region have been recorded, with no sales in the North and South regions. Query 4 displays total inventories in warehouses, indicating that the North warehouse has 131,688 units with a warehouse percentage capacity of 72%, while the South warehouse has 79,380 units with a warehouse percentage capacity of 75%. Interestingly, the cost of inventory elimination in the South warehouse is lower than in the North, suggesting a potential distribution of South warehouse inventory to West and East warehouses. Additionally, optimizing transportation duration and costs can be achieved by utilizing the relationship between customers and warehouses.

2.Analyzing Inventory-Sales Relationship:

Query 5 examines the relationship between sales figures and inventory numbers, ordering the list by total product sales. Some products show shortages in inventory; for example, the 1968 Ford Mustang, the ninth most profitable product with 933 orders, has only 68 units in inventory. Immediate production and prioritized stocking are recommended to meet demand. The inventory levels for the 1997 BMW F650 ST and 1928 Mercedes-Benz SSK are extremely low and fall short of meeting requirements.

3.Identifying Non-Moving Items and Candidates for Removal:
The absence of orders for the 1985 Toyota Supra 's18_3233', coupled with a stock quantity of 7,733 units, indicates a lack of demand. Therefore, it is advisable to consider removing this item from the product line. Additionally, the inventory levels of 12 items are critical, requiring increased stocking, particularly for unsold items, where the quantity should not be decreased.
