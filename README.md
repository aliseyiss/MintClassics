1) Load 'mintclassicsDB' MySQL Codes to Create Your Database

2) Gain Insights into Tables and Relations

Examine the tables and their relationships in the 'mintclassicsDB' by referring to the 'mintclassics_Tableview.png' file.

3) Explore Results in the 'Mint_Notebook.ipynb' Notebook

Open the 'Mint_Notebook.ipynb' file using Azure Data Studio. The notebook conveniently displays the results of each query at the bottom of the respective query, facilitating a better understanding of the queries.

4) SQL Codes in Separate Files - Consider Creating Views

  Each SQL code is organized in separate files. It is recommended to create views for enhanced query readability. Activation of the        comment lines within the code files enables the creation of views.


  Creating view is adviced.


The Project Scenario

Overview

In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at the fictional Mint Classics Company, helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.


Project Scenario

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

As a data analyst, you have been asked to use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data. You will be provided with a data model and sample data tables to review. You will then need to isolate and identify those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory. You will write queries to answer questions like these:

a. Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?

b. How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?

c. Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

The answers to questions like those should help you to formulate suggestions and recommendations for reducing inventory with the goal of closing one of the storage facilities. 

Project Objectives

A. Explore products currently in inventory.

B. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

C. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

Your Challenge

Your challenge will be to conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities. To do this, you will import the database and then analyze data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using SQL queries to retrieve data from the database provided.

In this project, we'll use the fictional Mint Classics relational database and a relational data model. Both will be provided.
